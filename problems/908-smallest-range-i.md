## üìù Problem Description

Given an array `nums` of integers, for each integer `nums[i]` you can choose any integer `x` from `[-k, k]` and add it to `nums[i]`. After this process, you have a new array `result`.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of `result` and the minimum value of `result`.

## Real-world analogy

Imagine `nums` is a list of temperatures in different rooms in a large building. Your goal is to make the temperature difference (the "score") between the **hottest** and **coldest** rooms as small as possible.

You have a special remote (`k`) that can change the temperature in any room by at most `k` degrees (e.g., +/- 3 degrees).

What's your strategy? You don't care about the rooms with average temperatures. You would:

1.  Go to the **coldest room** (the `min` of `nums`) and turn the heat **all the way up** (`min + k`).
2.  Go to the **hottest room** (the `max` of `nums`) and turn the A/C **all the way down** (`max - k`).

You are trying to push the two extremes toward the middle. The other rooms can all be adjusted to fall somewhere in between these two new temperatures. The *new* smallest possible difference will be the difference between these two adjusted extremes.

## üí° Key Idea

The core idea is to minimize the difference between the new maximum and new minimum values. To do this, we should make the new maximum as small as possible and the new minimum as large as possible.

- The smallest possible new maximum is `max(nums) - k`.
- The largest possible new minimum is `min(nums) + k`.

The new difference is `(max(nums) - k) - (min(nums) + k)`, which simplifies to `max(nums) - min(nums) - 2k`. If this result is negative, it means the range can be closed completely, making the minimum possible difference `0`.

## üßÆ Complexity Analysis

- Time: `O(N)` (to find the min and max values)
- Space: `O(1)`
