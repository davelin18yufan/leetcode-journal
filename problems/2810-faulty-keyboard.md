## 📝 Problem Description
This problem requires simulating a faulty keyboard. For every character typed, it is appended to a string. However, when the character 'i' is typed, it reverses the entire string that has been typed so far.

## 💡 Key Idea
Directly reversing a string repeatedly is inefficient. The optimal approach is to use a mutable data structure, like an array, to build the output. Characters are appended to the array. When an 'i' is encountered, the array is reversed in-place. This is significantly faster than string manipulation. The final string is generated by joining the array once at the end.

## 🧮 Complexity Analysis
- **Time:** O(N*L), where N is the input length and L is the current array length. This can approach O(N^2) in the worst case, but is much faster in practice than string concatenation due to optimized array operations.
- **Space:** O(N), to store the characters in the result array.

## 📖 Notes
- **Real-world analogy:** This is similar to a text editor's undo/redo history, where actions can modify the entire state of the document. A more direct analogy is a special command in a code editor that reverses the current line of text. Using an array to manage the text is like editing the line's content in a buffer before displaying the final result.
- **Edge cases considered:** An empty input string, a string with no 'i' characters, and a string containing consecutive 'i's (which would reverse the string back and forth).
